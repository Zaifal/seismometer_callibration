Hello guys, my name is Muhammad Zaifal.
I made this project to comlete my bachelors study

This  apps used to help engineers in geophisycals callibration lab to pick amplitudes samples from seismometers callibration and calculate its sensitivity.
the end product is a certificate of callibration in pdf.

but theres still some problem in this apps:
1. its still semi-automatic especially in frequency classification
2. it needs to be run in Windows OS
3. it needs installed microsoft excel to calculate and make an pdf templates.
4. its still hard to run a file seed with a lot of noise
